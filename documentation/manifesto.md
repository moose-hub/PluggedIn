🤗 TEAM MANIFESTO 🤗

- 🏫 Learn together! If you don't understand something, pair with someone and learn it - stick with the 80/20 (strengths/learning) rule so we can keep on top of our project.

- 💪 Health first - take breaks, ask for help

- 🎮 Daily energizers!

- 🃏 If at an impasse - use planning poker and discuss

- 🤝 Daily morning, midday standups and evening retros.

- 🥳 Celebrate each others successes!

- 🌃 Coding out of hours is encouraged to meet goals - remembering to create branches and get the team up to speed during the stand up.

- 👨‍💻👩‍💻 Focus on the MVP - then improve and refactor after.

- 😁 Be realistic with managing expectations - don't be too ambitious.

- 💡 Remember to share resources and learning methods with the team! :)
